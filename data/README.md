# Visualising the UK’s LGBTQ+ population

## Data sources

*Kirstie Ken English & Nicola Rennie*

The raw data downloaded from census websites can be found in the `raw-data` folder, and the [README](https://github.com/nrennie/rainbowR-VisLGBTQ/blob/main/raw-data/README.md) explains where each data set came from. 

The raw data was processed to create the clean data sets in the `data` folder. The processing code can be found in `code/00_clean_data.R`.
